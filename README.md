# Titanic

My personal analysis done on the first project of Udemy course "Learning Python for data analysis and visualization" based on Kaggle challenge. 

The dataset is explored to answer the following questions :

1) Who were the passengers? (Ages,Gender,Class)

2) What deck were the passengers on?

3) Where did the passengers come from?

4) Who was alone and who was with family?

5) Who survived and what characteristics helped survival?
